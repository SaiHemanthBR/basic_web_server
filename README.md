# Nano Web Server

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE.md)

Nano Web Server is a simple, multi-threaded, web server written using POSIX Sockets. Uses a process-driven approach and creates a new thread for each request. This web server can only host simple static webpages with no server-size processing. As of v2, it does not conform to any HTTP protocol. This is a learning project and is not intended to be used in a production environment.

I might implement HTTP protocol standards later, but no guarantees.
