/**

 * @brief Function Prototypes for creating, sending and handling network responses.
 *
 * This file contains the function prototypes to create response for a network request,
 * manage response headers and send response back to the client. It also contains prototypes for
 * internal function to handle response creation and memory management.
 *
 * Implemented in slib/response.c
